# NIRC

Nathan's Internet Relay Chat (NIRC) is Nathan's implementation of an encrypted terminal-based chat application that allows anyone to host their own server and allow others to join.

Roadmap:
- [ ] Encryption
- [ ] Figure out hosting (not on Local)
- [ ] Usernames
- [ ] Allow host to simultaniously be a client
- [ ] Get messages across multiple clients working
- [x] CLI functional
